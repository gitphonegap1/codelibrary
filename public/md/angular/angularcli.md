### Angular Cli
---

It is a command line interface helps create and install Angular project templates with boilerplate code. To install it, use the command: `npm install @angular/cli`.


### Key Features of Angular CLI:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Easily create a new Angular project with a single command (`ng new`).
   - Automatically generates the required files and folders, along with configuration settings.

2. **Code Generation**:
   - Quickly generate Angular components, services, modules, directives, pipes, etc., using `ng generate` commands.
   - Enforces best practices by creating files with the correct structure and naming conventions.

3. **Development Server**:
   - Spin up a local development server with live reloading using the `ng serve` command.
   - Automatically rebuilds and reloads the application as you make changes to the code.

4. **Testing Support**:
   - Run unit tests with `ng test` and end-to-end tests with `ng e2e`.
   - Configures the testing environment using popular testing frameworks like Jasmine and Protractor.

5. **Build Optimization**:
   - Build your application for production with the `ng build --prod` command.
   - Performs various optimizations such as ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, minification, and tree-shaking to reduce bundle sizes.

6. **Configuration Management**:
   - Manage different environments (development, production, etc.) with configuration files.
   - Easily switch between environments using command options (e.g., `ng build --configuration=production`).

7. **Linting and Formatting**:
   - Run linting tools to ensure your code adheres to best practices (`ng lint`).
   - Customize linting rules to enforce specific coding standards within your project.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Simplifies the deployment process to various platforms, including GitHub Pages, Firebase, and more with commands like `ng deploy`.

9. **Third-Party Libraries Integration**:
   - Easily add popular libraries and dependencies to your project using the `ng add` command.

10. **Version Control Integration**:
    - Automatically integrates with version control systems like Git, allowing you to create, clone, and manage repositories directly from the CLI.

11. **Updates and Maintenance**:
    - Keep your Angular dependencies up to date using the `ng update` command, ensuring your project stays current with the latest Angular features and fixes.

Angular CLI is an essential tool for Angular developers, providing a streamlined workflow and enhancing productivity by automating repetitive tasks and enforcing best practices.
