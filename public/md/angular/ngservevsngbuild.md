### Ng Serve vs Ng Build
---

1. `ng serve`: Builds the application in memory(RAM) and make the application available to access through browser. We can access the application using the following url `http://localhost:4200`. Here the default port is `4200` and change the port using `--port 4300`.

2. `ng build`: Builds the applicatin in physical device. When ever we run this command it build the aplication in the `dist` folder in the aspplication folder.
