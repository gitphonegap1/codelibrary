#### How PWAs Work

A PWA is a standard web app but enhanced with specific technologies:

1. **Service Workers:** These are JavaScript files that run separately from the web page or app, enabling features like offline support, background sync, and push notifications.

2. **Web App Manifest:** A JSON file that provides metadata about the web app (like name, icons, start URL, display options, etc.), allowing it to be installed on the user's device.

3. **HTTPS:** PWAs must be served over HTTPS to ensure data integrity and security, which is required to use service workers and other advanced web APIs.


A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a web application that uses modern web technologies to deliver a fast, reliable, and engaging user experience, similar to a native mobile app. Here are the key features and benefits of PWAs:
