### Data Binding
---

How the view and component communicate each other.

There are four types of data binding

1. **Interpollation**

   The data flows from component to view. We use `{{}}` to bind the data. 

2. **Property Binding**
   
   The data flows from component to view. We use `[]` to bind the data to the HTML tags

3. **Event Binding**

   The data flows from view to component. We use `()` to bind the event to the element in HTML.

4. **Two way data binding**

   Here the data flow form component to view and view to component. We use `[()]` to bind the data to HTML element.
