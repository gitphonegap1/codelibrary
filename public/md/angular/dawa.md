### Developing Accessible Web Applications in Angular
---


To develop an Angular application accessible to disabled persons, you need to follow best practices for **web accessibility** to ensure your application is usable by people with various disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments.

### Key Steps for Developing an Accessible Angular Application

1. **Use Semantic HTML Elements:**
   - Use appropriate HTML elements (`<button>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.) to define the structure of your application. Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on these elements to interpret content correctly.
   
2. **Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Attributes:**
   - Use ARIA roles, properties, and states (e.g., `role="button"`, `aria-live`, `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`) to provide additional information to assistive technologies about the dynamic content or interactive elements.
   - Example: Adding an accessible label to a custom button component.

   ```html
   <button aria-label="Submit form" (click)="submitForm()">Submit</button>
   ```

3. **Provide Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls) are accessible using the keyboard (e.g., `Tab`, `Enter`, `Space`). Use the `tabindex` attribute to control tab order and make sure focus states are visible.
   - Example: Ensuring custom components are keyboard-accessible.

   ```html
   <div role="button" tabindex="0" (keydown.enter)="handleClick()">Clickable Item</div>
   ```

4. **Use Color and Contrast Appropriately:**
   - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG AA or AAA). Use tools like the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to test color contrast.
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey information (e.g., use text, icons, or patterns).

5. **Provide Text Alternatives:**
   - Use `alt` attributes for images to provide alternative text for users who rely on screen readers.
   - Provide text equivalents for non-text content (e.g., icons, images, videos, and charts).

   ```html
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">
   ```

6. **Use Accessible Forms:**
   - Ensure all form elements have associated labels. Use `<label>` elements or `aria-label` attributes to associate labels with input fields.
   - Example: An accessible form field.

   ```html
   <label for="username">Username</label>
   <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
   ```

7. **Ensure Dynamic Content is Announced to Assistive Technologies:**
   - Use ARIA live regions (e.g., `aria-live="polite"`) for dynamic content that changes without a full page reload, ensuring that screen readers announce these changes appropriately.

   ```html
   <div aria-live="polite">New message received.</div>
   ```

8. **Implement Responsive Design:**
   - Use responsive design principles to ensure your application is usable on different devices and orientations, benefiting users with different assistive technologies.

9. **Use Accessible Angular Libraries:**
   - Use Angular libraries designed for accessibility, such as **Angular Material** or **ngx-bootstrap**, which offer accessible UI components out-of-the-box.
   - Example: Using Angular Material's accessible button component.

   ```html
   <button mat-button aria-label="Save changes">Save</button>
   ```

10. **Test with Accessibility Tools and Assistive Technologies:**
    - Regularly test your application using accessibility tools like **axe**, **Lighthouse**, or **NVDA** (NonVisual Desktop Access) screen reader.
    - Use browser extensions like **axe DevTools** or **Accessibility Insights for Web** to check for accessibility violations.

### Conclusion

By implementing these practices, you ensure your Angular application is accessible to disabled persons, providing a better user experience for everyone. Additionally, it helps you comply with legal standards like the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** and improves the usability of your application for all users.
