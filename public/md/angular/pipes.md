### Pipes
---

Pipes are simple functions that use template expressions to accept data as input and transform it into a desired output. For example, let us take a pipe to transform a component's birthday property into a human-friendly date using date pipe.

**Tyoes of Pipes**

1. **Builtin Pipes:** DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, JsonPipe, etc...
2. **Custom Pipes**: We can create your own custom pipes when the built-in ones do not meet your needs
