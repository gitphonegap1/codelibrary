### Is JavaScript statically typed or dynamically typed? State the reasons.
---
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and a variable can hold any type of data.

```javascript
// Example of dynamic typing
let myVar = 42;      // myVar is a number
myVar = "Hello";     // myVar is now a string
myVar = true;        // myVar is now a boolean
```
